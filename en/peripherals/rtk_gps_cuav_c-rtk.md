# CUAV C-RTK

The [CUAV C-RTK GPS receiver](http://doc.cuav.net/gps/c-rtk/en/) is a RTK module for mass market launched by CUAV. The complete RTK system consists of at least two C-RTK modules \(one for the base station and the others for the aircraft\). Using RTK, PX4 can get its position with centimetre-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.
